## Propensity modelling
Framework to predict the likelihood that subjects (non-customers, potential customers or customers) will perform certain actions. 

The company may encourage the subjects to perform according according to the following strategies:

- Cross-sell: invite customers to buy related or complementary items. 
- Next-best-action: take an account determined by the customer's interests and needs on the one hand, and the marketing organization's business objectives & policies on the other. In a sales context, this strategy is usually termed *next-best-offer*. 

## Uplift modelling
