# Tasks
Analytic tasks can be classified according to the following:
- Type of reasoning: 
  - Inductive
  - Deductive
- Type of induction/analytics
  - Description: answer what happened using historical data
  - Prediction: answer what will happen using historical data and a prediction model
  - Prescription: answer what should we do using historical data, a prediction model (machine learning) and a decision model (operations research).
- Type of task: regression, classification, clustering, subgroup discovery, ...

# Methods
The techniques used to solve a certain task are called methods.

> Pending: Build a big table indicating the following properties for each method. Or a graph showing relationships, generalizations, definitions, etc...

# Optimization concepts
- (True/Statistical) Risk: optmization on the cost expectation over the joint distribution of inputs and outputs
- Empirical risk: optimization on the cost average over the training set inputs and outputs
- Loss function
- Regularization
