# Graph Machine Learning
## In-graph Machine Learning
- Node classification: what kind of node is this?
- Link classification: should these two nodes be connected?

## Embeddings
- Node2Vec
- GraphSAGE
- FastRP

## Node centrality
- PageRank: Simple explanation [here](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math19b_2011/handouts/lecture34.pdf)
- Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS), a.k.a. Hubs & Authorities
